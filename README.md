# 🦴 Osteoarthritis Classification Using CNN

A deep learning project focused on classifying the severity levels of osteoarthritis from medical imaging using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project involves building and training a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify osteoarthritis severity levels from X-ray or MRI images. The goal was to aid in early diagnosis and better treatment planning by automating visual assessment of medical images.

### 🔍 Problem
Manual diagnosis of osteoarthritis can be time-consuming and subjective. By applying deep learning, we aim to support clinicians with faster, more consistent classification.
